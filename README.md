These are the source codes of our FRI-based handover authentication protocol in Vehicular Networks implemented using Python and simulated in Mininet-WiFi.

We implemented 4 other protocols proposed in other research papers and their PDFs are in the respective folders.

The simulation video for Initial authentication of our protocol is recorded in **FRI_Hand_Initial_Auth_5_Vehicles.webm** file

The simulation video for Handover authentication of our protocol is recorded in **FRI_Hand_Handover_Auth_4_Vehicles.webm** file

Thank you.
